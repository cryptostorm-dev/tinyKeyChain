# tinyKeyChain

Unofficial fork/update of TinyCA2 http://www.sm-zone.net/

A tcl-based tool for simplifying the horrors of format & encodings conversions when doing work at the overlap between x.509 & RSA? 

Oh, hell yes! :-)

Well, perhaps best to do some code-review before getting too excited. Still, it's a useful find.

KeyChain isn't really a "Certification Authority" in any conventional sense, but it does need to interface with legacy cert/CA/x.509 infrastructure and as such these sorts of conversion utilities become really important.
